## Abstract:
Skin lesions refer to changes in the appearance, texture, or sensation of the skin, resulting from damage to its structure. These lesions can have various causes, reflecting the complexity of the skin, the largest organ of the human body. Given the importance of the skin as a physical and immunological barrier, accurate classification of lesions plays a crucial role in medical practice, allowing determination of their benign or malignant potential and ensuring appropriate, timely, and often lifesaving treatment. With technological advancements, the application of deep learning in skin lesion classification emerges as a promising tool, offering an efficient approach to assist healthcare professionals in this diagnostic process. The proposed methodology begins with data collection and preparation, using publicly available datasets containing pre-labeled images of skin lesions. Next, established convolutional neural network architectures, such as LeNet, VGG Net, and ResNet, are utilized through the Python programming language and resources from the PyTorch library. With the aid of the described methodology, the aim is to facilitate learning and application of advanced deep learning concepts in practice, as well as experience in the research process. In conclusion, the project's main objective is the development of trained and tested deep learning models capable of accurately classifying the benignity or malignancy of skin lesions. Additionally, it seeks to contribute to the academic community and promote interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering continued interest in the field for future projects.
